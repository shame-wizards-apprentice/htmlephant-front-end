# Wizards and Whiteboards

## Description
A dungeon-crawler RPG built using React.js and Redux, designed to teach basic coding concepts and provide practice for algorithm challenges to new developers seeking a fun and interactive way to implement their skills. Explore the caverns of Castle Full Stack and gain wisdom from Zac, Aslan, and Denis before facing the ultimate challenge with Joe the Dev Wizard.

Move around using the arrow keys, or click on the directional pad below the monitor. Bump into Joe and he will introduce you to Castle Full Stack and tell you the rules of the game. Bump into other NPCs and answer their multiple choice questions to receive a salmon. Gather three salmon, then return to Joe and you will be presented with an algorithm challenge in the Great Salmon Code Editor. Your code will be evaluated, and if it passes our test, you shall move on to the next level. Gain level three, and you receive the ultimate prize: a joe.joe email address.
