// I was originally using this file as a function that fired off the whiteboard, but now I think it might be worth it to try creating a piece of state with a modal and using a dispatch to render it. I think I'msaying that right.


import { render } from "@testing-library/react"
import React from "react"
import Whiteboard from "./Whiteboard"


export default fireQuestion() {
   render(){
    <div>
       <Whiteboard/>
       </div>
   }
    
}
