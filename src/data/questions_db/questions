Welcome! You are entering a world of magic---well, magic that is made up of data, computer science and algorithms. I swear, it's a lot cooler than it sounds. I am Joe, the Dev Wizard, and this is Castle Full Stack. One day, perhaps you will possess all the knowledge held in these walls, but for now, let's focus on one thing: algorithms. Seek out the Wizard Assistants in the castle, and they will share their coding knowledge with you. Each Wiz will ask you a series of questions. Once you complete all the questions, you will get a key. Once you have a key, come back to see me to test what you've learned. Good luck, and ABC (Always Be Coding)!
